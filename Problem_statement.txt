

Predict: 
	- Drop off location for every pick up at any moment in time.

How:
	- Kalman filter
		- States: number of bikes in each hub as a time series
		- Events: pick up and drop off.

ANN:
	- predict number of bikes in each hub:
	inputs: vector of pick ups discrete in time. drop offs?
	output: difference in hub number of bikes 

	Discretize by seassons, dismiss special events


Output number of bikes or additional bikes
